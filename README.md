# 🔌 Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the electric vehicle (EV) market size in the United States using publicly available EV registration data. It covers the growth in EV adoption over time and explores regional trends to understand how EV popularity is spreading geographically.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The dataset underwent preprocessing to ensure accuracy, remove duplicates, and address missing values. The goal was to create a clean foundation for effective visual analysis.

## 📈 Key Analyses

- **EV Adoption Over Time**  
  A time-series analysis reveals a consistent increase in EV registrations, with notable acceleration starting in 2016. The year 2023 marked the highest jump in EV registrations, indicating peak adoption levels.

- **Geographical Distribution**  
  The dataset is explored by region and state to identify hotspots of EV ownership. This helps illustrate how state-level policies, incentives, and infrastructure contribute to adoption rates.
